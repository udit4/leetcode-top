Approach


1. Check if the given number is greater than (3) than include 2, 3 also
2. Also while iterating skip all the even (ith-index numbers, as they cant be prime)
3. Also in the function to calculate the prime, do untill the square root of the number and also skip the even numbers in this also

4. So the overall complexity will be - O(n*sqrt(n))
